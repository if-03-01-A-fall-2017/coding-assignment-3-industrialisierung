          <em>
            In England, absolutism and landlordism had been loosened earlier than in other European countries,<br>
            but in contrast to German countries, there was no longer any compulsory guild. <br>
            This encouraged the free expansion of trade, capital formation and technical renewal. <br>
            The insular situation of England made possible the trans-regional traffic and goods transport by sea ship between port cities.<br>
            Milestones were the invention of the steam engine (invention 1712 by Thomas Newcomen, crucial further development 1769 by James Watt),<br>
            the spinning machine (spinning Jenny), the mechanical loom, the machine tool and the Puddelverfahrens in the iron extraction.<br>
            The invention of the steam locomotive and the first public railways marked the end of the (first) Industrial Revolution in England.

        <strong>
          <em>
            Industrialization is also used as a term for today's standardization / automation of processes / processes. <br>
            As an example, the software development is called: During programming, no object is produced in the traditional sense.<br>
            The manufacture of the product software can be considered as a manual activity in many companies, as it is done differently and individually each time.<br>
            The aim of industrialization is to standardize common manufacturing elements so that they can be used more effectively, more productively and uniformly.<br>
            Only if the individual phases are characterized, for example, parts can be delivered as Offshoring activity.<br>
            At an early stage an industrial critique was expressed during industrialization, which later turned into ecological criticism.<br>
